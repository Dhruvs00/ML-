Applied  various EDA techniques to visualize, pre-process, and clean the data , studied the correlations amongst attributes, perform feature transformations etc. 
and prepared the dataset for modeling (machine learning).

Applied the method  Normal Equations and Pseudo-inverse to compute the optimal parameters. 

Using OLS library, studied the statistical properties of my models to find  which attributes/features are significant and the confidence interval for each of them

Used Gradient Descent and experimented with learning rate hyper-parameter , used KNN (non-parametric approach).

Built 2 GLM models with different link functions and Poisson and Gaussian distributions.

Used the  validation approach to select the best model and provided the predictions for the test set as predictions.csv file .
